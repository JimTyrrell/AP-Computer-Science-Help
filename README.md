When making a program you need to decide on the nouns, i.e. the variables that will hold state.  You also need to think about the verbs, or the things that will give live to your program.

Use good objected oriented design tradecraft when designing your object.  
 - Think about the constructor and the value/s that should be passed in.  
 - Think about the getter methods you will want, sevearl getTheAction(); methods should exist.
 - Think about return types and don't cross up int's and double's.
 - Make sure you have a toString so you can see what is going on with your progam.
 - Speed to code and ensuring program correctness is very important, this is where maven comes in.
